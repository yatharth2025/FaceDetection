# FaceDetection
This project implements a face detection and recognition system using Python. It utilizes OpenCV (cv2) for real-time video capture and image processing, face_recognition for accurate face encoding and matching, and NumPy for numerical computations. The project also includes a simple Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction.
